\begin{abstract}
ROOT is a framework for large-scale data analysis that provides basic and advanced statistical methods used by the LHC experiments. In particular, these include machine learning algorithms from the ROOT-integrated toolkit for multi-variate analysis (TMVA). We present recent developments in TMVA as well as interfaces between ROOT and other statistical tools such as R.
\end{abstract}



\section{Introduction}
ROOT is a modular object-oriented C++ data analysis framework\cite{Antcheva20092499}, 
that provides statistical methods, advanced visualization and storage libraries 
needed by the High Energy Physics experiments for data analysis. TMVA is a ROOT-integrated toolkit that implements machine-learning algorithms\cite{Hocker:2007ht}. Figure \ref{tmva:label} shows the interfaces between ROOT, TMVA and other statistical tools. TMVA provides a set of algorithms widely used in High Energy Physics (HEP):

\begin{itemize}  

\item BDT(Boosted Decision Trees)

\item ANN(Artificial Neural Networks)

\item SVM(Support Vector Machines)

\item and others

\end{itemize}
Recently TMVA has  been undergoing a lot of improvements targeting  greater flexibility, more modular design and novel features and interfaces. In the next sections we describe some of the new features and functionality of TMVA.

\subsection{DataLoader}



DataLoader is a new class in TMVA that allows greater
modularity and flexibility for training different classifiers
with different features. In a DataLoader a user defines what data to use and which features will be used. Multiple DataLoaders are allowed at the same time.\newline
Figures \ref{dl1}, \ref{dl2} and \ref{dl3} show the structure of the TMVA::Factory class and the new DataLoader class. Using DataLoader class users can load data from ROOT and CSV (comma separated values) files.

\subsection{Variable Importance}


Stochastic variable importance algorithm described in \cite{gleyzer2008paradigm}, 
has been implemented in TMVA. Figure \ref{vi} shows the output of the algorithm for a basic example in TMVA.

% Algorithm ranks the importance of a variable in

% classfication processes \cite{gleyzer2008paradigm}. Figure \ref{vi}

% \begin{itemize}

% \item The method take a subset of variables and compute

% weights.

% 

% \begin{equation}

% FI(X_{i})= \sum_{S\subseteq{V}:X_{i}\in{S}}{F(S)xW_{X_{i}}(S)}

% \end{equation}

% \begin{itemize}

% \item Full variable set {V}

% \item Variable subset {S}

% \item Classifier Performance F(S)

% \end{itemize}

% \item It is independent of the classifier.

% \item Is a stochastic algorithm.

% \end{itemize}

\subsection{ROOT-R}\label{ROOTR}


R  is a free software framework for statistical computing\cite{R}. We developed the ROOT-R package which allows the  use of R functions directly in ROOT. This interface opens a large set of statistical tools in R for use within ROOT. The ROOT-R design flow chart is shown in (Figure \ref{rootr:label}). 



\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=25pc]{img/rootr.png}\caption{\label{rootr:label} ROOT-R design.}
\end{figure}



\subsection{ROOT-R with TMVA (RMVA)}\label{RMVA}


RMVA is a set of plugins for TMVA based on the ROOT-R interface described in Section \ref{ROOTR}. RMVA is an interface that allows the use of machine-learning methods in R in TMVA. Currently the following methods are supported, but additional ones can be added easily to the RMVA interface. Each of the methods inherits from the base class RMethodBase (Figure \ref{rmvaplug}).


(Figure \ref{rmvadf}) 

\begin{itemize}  

\item (C50) C5.0 decision trees and rule-based models for pattern

recognition\cite{c50}.

\item (RSNNS) Neural Networks in R using the Stuttgart Neural

Network Simulator (SNNS)\cite{rsnns}.

\item (e1071) Support Vector Machine Implementation in R, useful for classification, regression and density estimation. A formula interface is provided\cite{e1071}.

\item eXtreme Gradient Boost (R package xgboost) An optimized

general purpose gradient boosting library\cite{chen2015xgboost}.

\end{itemize}



Performance of the various methods can be compared within the TMVA framework (Figure \ref{rmvaroc})

\subsection{Python with TMVA (PyMVA)} \label{PYMVA}
PyMVA is a set of TMVA plugins based on Python API that opens additional machine-learning methods written in python to be used from TMVA. Each PyMVA method inherits from the base class PyMethodBase (Figure \ref{pymvaplug}). In this plugin objects of PyArrayObject class are used to map the dataset from ROOT trees to numpy arrays in python.(Figure \ref{pymvadf}). Following methods are currently available in TMVA. \cite{pedregosa2011scikit}.

\begin{itemize}

\item PyRandomForest: Random Forest Implementation

\item PyGTB (Gradient Trees Boosted) : Gradient Tree Boosting or Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) is an accurate and effective off-the-shelf procedure that can be used for both regression and classification problems.

\item PyAdaBoost (Adaptative Boosting):The core principle of AdaBoost is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small
decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data. 

\end{itemize}



Figure \ref{pymvaroc} shows the ROC curves of various PyMVA methods for a basic example.

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% In the online version of \jpcs\ references will be linked to their original source or to the article within a secondary service such as INSPEC or ChemPort wherever possible. To facilitate this linking extra care should be taken when preparing reference lists. 

% 

% Two different styles of referencing are in common use: the Harvard alphabetical system and the Vancouver numerical system.  For \jpcs, the Vancouver numerical system is preferred but authors should use the Harvard alphabetical system if they wish to do so. In the numerical system references are numbered sequentially throughout the text within square brackets, like this [2], and one number can be used to designate several references.  

% 

% \subsection{Using \BibTeX}

% We highly recommend the {\ttfamily\textbf\selectfont iopart-num} \BibTeX\ package by Mark~A~Caprio \cite{iopartnum}, which is included with this documentation.

% 

% \subsection{Reference lists}

% A complete reference should provide the reader with enough information to locate the article concerned, whether published in print or electronic form, and should, depending on the type of reference, consist of:  

% 

% \begin{itemize}

% \item name(s) and initials;

% \item date published;

% \item title of journal, book or other publication; 

% \item titles of journal articles may also be included (optional);

% \item volume number;

% \item editors, if any;

% \item town of publication and publisher in parentheses for {\it books};

% \item the page numbers.

% \end{itemize}

% 

% Up to ten authors may be given in a particular reference; where 

% there are more than ten only the first should be given followed by 

% `{\it et al}'. If an author is unsure of a particular journal's abbreviated title it is best to leave the title in 

% full. The terms {\it loc.\ cit.\ }and {\it ibid.\ }should not be used. 

% Unpublished conferences and reports should generally not be included 

% in the reference list and articles in the course of publication should 

% be entered only if the journal of publication is known. 

% A thesis submitted for a higher degree may be included 

% in the reference list if it has not been superseded by a published 

% paper and is available through a library; sufficient information 

% should be given for it to be traced readily.

% 

% \subsection{Formatting reference lists}

% Numeric reference lists should contain the references within an unnumbered section (such as \verb"\section*{References}"). The 

% reference list itself is started by the code 

% \verb"\begin{thebibliography}{<num>}", where \verb"<num>" is the largest

% number in the reference list and is completed by

% \verb"\end{thebibliography}". 

% Each reference starts with \verb"\bibitem{<label>}", where `label' is the label used for cross-referencing. Each \verb"\bibitem" should only contain a reference to a single article (or a single article and a preprint reference to the same article).  When one number actually covers a group of two or more references to different articles, \verb"\nonum"

% should replace \verb"\bibitem{<label>}" at

% the start of each reference in the group after the first.

% 

% For an alphabetic reference list use \verb"\begin{thereferences}" ... \verb"\end{thereferences}" instead of the

% `thebibliography' environment and each reference can be start with just \verb"\item" instead of \verb"\bibitem{label}"

% as cross referencing is less useful for alphabetic references.

% 

% \subsection {References to printed journal articles}

% A normal reference to a journal article contains three changes of font (see table \ref{jfonts}) and is constructed as follows:

% 

% \begin{itemize}

% \item the authors should be in the form surname (with only the first letter capitalized) followed by the initials with no periods after the initials. Authors should be separated by a comma except for the last two which should be separated by `and' with no comma preceding it;

% \item the article title (if given) should be in lower case letters, except for an initial capital, and should follow the date;

% \item the journal title is in italic and is abbreviated. If a journal has several parts denoted by different letters the part letter should be inserted after the journal in Roman type, e.g. {\it Phys. Rev.} A;

% \item the volume number should be in bold type;

% \item both the initial and final page numbers should be given where possible. The final page number should be in the shortest possible form and separated from the initial page number by an en rule `-- ', e.g. 1203--14, i.e. the numbers `12' are not repeated.

% \section{Tables and table captions}

% Tables should be numbered serially and referred to in the text 

% by number (table 1, etc, {\bf rather than} tab. 1). Each table should be a float and be positioned within the text at the most convenient place near to where it is first mentioned in the text. It should have an 

% explanatory caption which should be as concise as possible. 

% 

% \subsection{The basic table format}

% The standard form for a table is:

% \begin{verbatim}

% \begin{table}

% \caption{\label{label}Table caption.}

% \begin{center}

% \begin{tabular}{llll}

% \br

% Head 1&Head 2&Head 3&Head 4\\

% \mr

% 1.1&1.2&1.3&1.4\\

% 2.1&2.2&2.3&2.4\\

% \br

% \end{tabular}

% \end{center}

% \end{table}

% \end{verbatim}

% 

% The above code produces table~\ref{ex}.

% 

% \begin{table}[h]

% \caption{\label{ex}Table caption.}

% \begin{center}

% \begin{tabular}{llll}

% \br

% Head 1&Head 2&Head 3&Head 4\\

% \mr

% 1.1&1.2&1.3&1.4\\

% 2.1&2.2&2.3&2.4\\

% \br

% \end{tabular}

% \end{center}

% \end{table}

% 

% Points to note are:

% \medskip

% \begin{enumerate}

% \item The caption comes before the table.

% \item The normal style is for tables to be centred in the same way as

% equations. This is accomplished

% by using \verb"\begin{center}" \dots\ \verb"\end{center}".

% 

% \item The default alignment of columns should be aligned left.

% 

% \item Tables should have only horizontal rules and no vertical ones. The rules at

% the top and bottom are thicker than internal rules and are set with

% \verb"\br" (bold rule). 

% The rule separating the headings from the entries is set with

% \verb"\mr" (medium rule). These commands do not need a following double backslash.

% 

% \item Numbers in columns should be aligned as appropriate, usually on the decimal point;

% to help do this a control sequence \verb"\lineup" has been defined 

% which sets \verb"\0" equal to a space the size of a digit, \verb"\m"

% to be a space the width of a minus sign, and \verb"\-" to be a left

% overlapping minus sign. \verb"\-" is for use in text mode while the other

% two commands may be used in maths or text.

% (\verb"\lineup" should only be used within a table

% environment after the caption so that \verb"\-" has its normal meaning

% elsewhere.) See table~\ref{tabone} for an example of a table where

% \verb"\lineup" has been used.

% Figures must be included in the source code of an article at the appropriate place in the text not grouped together at the end. 

% 

% Each figure should have a brief caption describing it and, if

% Authors should try and use the space allocated to them as economically as possible. At times it may be convenient to put two figures side by side or the caption at the side of a figure. To put figures side by side, within a figure environment, put each figure and its caption into a minipage with an appropriate width (e.g. 3in or 18pc if the figures are of equal size) and then separate the figures slightly by adding some horizontal space between the two minipages (e.g. \verb"\hspace{.2in}" or \verb"\hspace{1.5pc}". To get the caption at the side of the figure add the small horizontal space after the \verb"\includegraphics" command and then put the \verb"\caption" within a minipage of the appropriate width aligned bottom, i.e. \verb"\begin{minipage}[b]{3in}" etc (see code in this file used to generate figures 1--3).

% 

% Note that it may be necessary to adjust the size of the figures (using optional arguments to \verb"\includegraphics", for instance \verb"[width=3in]") to get you article to fit within your page allowance or to obtain good page breaks.
